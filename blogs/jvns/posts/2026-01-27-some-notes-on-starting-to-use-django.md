Hello! One of my favourite things is starting to learn an
Old Boring Technology that I’ve never tried before but that has been around for
20+ years. It feels really good when every problem I’m ever going to have has
been solved already 1000 times and I can just get stuff done easily.


I’ve thought it would be cool to learn a popular web framework like
Rails or Django or Laravel for a long time, but I’d never really managed to
make it happen. But I started learning Django to make a website a few months
back, I’ve been liking it so far, and here are a few quick notes!


### less magic than Rails


I spent some time [trying to learn Rails](https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/09/day-1--a-little-rails-/) in 2020,
and while it was cool and I really wanted to like Rails (the Ruby community is great!),
I found that if I left my Rails project alone for months, when I came
back to it it was hard for me to remember how to get anything done because
(for example) if it says `resources :topics` in your `routes.rb`, on its own
that doesn’t tell you where the `topics` routes are configured, you need to
remember or look up the convention.


Being able to abandon a project for months or years and then come back to it is
really important to me (that’s how all my projects work!), and Django feels easier
to me because things are more explicit.


In my small Django project it feels like I just have 5 main files (other
than the settings files): `urls.py`, `models.py`, `views.py`, `admin.py`, and
`tests.py`, and if I want to know where something else is (like an HTML template)
is then it’s usually explicitly referenced from one of those files.


### a built-in admin


For this project I wanted to have an admin interface to manually edit or view
some of the data in the database. Django has a really nice built-in admin
interface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.


For example, here’s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields
to display in the “list” view,  which field to search on, and how to order them
by default.


```
@admin.register(Zine)
class ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ["name", "publication_date", "free", "slug", "image_preview"]
    search_fields = ["name", "slug"]
    readonly_fields = ["image_preview"]
    ordering = ["-publication_date"]

```


### it’s fun to have an ORM


In the past my attitude has been “ORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!”.
I’ve been enjoying Django’s ORM so far though, and I think it’s cool how Django
uses `__` to represent a `JOIN`, like this:


```
Zine.objects
    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)

```


This query involves 5 tables: `zines`, `zine_products`, `products`, `order_products`, and `orders`.
To make this work I just had to tell Django that there’s a `ManyToManyField`
relating “orders” and “products”, and another `ManyToManyField` relating
“zines”, and “products”, so that it knows how to connect `zines`, `orders`, `products`.


I definitely *could* write that query, but writing `product__order__email_hash` is
a lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would
take me a little while to figure out how to construct the query
(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).


I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I’m
pretty excited about ORMs for now, though I’m sure I’ll find things to be
frustrated with eventually.


### automatic migrations!


The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!


If I add, delete, or change a field in `models.py`, Django will automatically
generate a migration script like `migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py`.


I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I’ve just
been running the generated scripts with no change and it’s been going great. It
really feels like magic.


I’m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right
now because I’m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want
it to work.


### I like the docs


I had a bad habit of [never reading the documentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMw1QTP2no)
but I’ve been really enjoying the parts of Django’s docs that I’ve read so far.
This isn’t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a
[talk from PyCon 2011](https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--writing-great-documentation.html)
on Django’s documentation culture.


For example the [intro to models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/db/models/)
lists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.


### using sqlite


After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to
understand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with
SQLite instead. It’s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by
just doing a `VACUUM INTO` and then copying the resulting single file.


I’ve been following [these instructions](https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production)
for using SQLite with Django in production.


I think it should be fine because I’m expecting the site to have a few hundred
writes per day at most, much less than [Mess with DNS](https://messwithdns.net/)
which has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are
split across 3 different SQLite databases).


### built in email (and more)


Django seems to be very “batteries-included”, which I love – if I want CSRF
protection, or a `Content-Security-Policy`, or I want to send email, it’s all
in there!


For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so
that it didn’t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit
of configuration.


I just put this `settings/dev.py`:


```
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / "emails"

```


and then set up the production email like this in `settings/production.py`


```
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend"
EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.whatever.com"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "xxxx"
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')

```


That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there’s
likely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.


### the settings file still feels like a lot


I’m still a bit intimidated by the `settings.py` file: Django’s settings system
works by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit
stressed about… what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?
How will I know? What if I type `WSGI_APPLICATOIN = "config.wsgi.application"`
instead of `WSGI_APPLICATION`?


I guess I’ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I’ve
made a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can’t rely on the
language server support.


### that’s all for now!


I haven’t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before
(right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static
sites), so I’m interested in seeing how it goes!


There’s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven’t really gotten into
Django’s form validation tooling or authentication systems.


Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.
