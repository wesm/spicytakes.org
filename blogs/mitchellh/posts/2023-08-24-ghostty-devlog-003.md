# Community Updates: Public Discord!


I'm excited to share that we now have a **[public Discord server](https://discord.gg/ghostty)**!
Anyone is welcome to join, ask questions about Ghostty, talk about
terminal emulators, talk about systems programming, GPU programming,
etc. We're also using the discord as a way to expand the beta program,
so if you're interested in joining the beta, please join the Discord server
and be somewhat active.


Next, I'll be giving a talk on Ghostty for [Zig Showtime](https://zig.show/)
on September 5th. Please keep an eye on the Zig showtime website, twitter,
masto, etc. for updates on exact times and links. The talk is still being
developed but the general topic will be a whirlwind tour of the implementation
of Ghostty while highlighting a few interesting spots. It is *Zig* showtime
after all so I will focus more on the Zig aspects of Ghostty.

# Keyboard Input Handling Hates You (#282)1


I'm just a dumb US citizen typing on a dumb US-standard keyboard layout.
On a US-standard keyboard, you type `a` and you get "a", you type `'`
(apostrophe) and you get "'". You type `shift+a` and you get "A". Easy,
easy. *You sit on a throne of lies.*


The first hint of trouble are non-standard but English-centric keyboard layouts
such as Dvorak or Colemak. On US-standard physical keyboards, a Dvorak user
types `s` and expects "o" and presses `ctrl+i` and expects `ctrl+c` behavior.


The second hint of trouble are unicode sequences. On Mac, on a US-standard
layout, `alt+a` produces `å`. The latest beta group added a Norwegian user
who noted this is particularly important because they prefer the US-standard
layout but use the alt-sequences to type Norwegian words.


The third hint of trouble are non-standard keyboard layouts. Do you know
what a [dead key sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key) is? I
didn't (because I'm just a dumb US-standard user, remember). On US-standard
layouts, we're used to all keyboard presses being stateless. To uppercase
a character, you type `shift+A` *at the same time*. With a dead key sequence
you'd type `shift`, let go, then type `a`, and then you'd see `A` (this
isn't a real world dead key sequence, but an example of what a dead key
sequence acts like). A real dead key sequence, on US international layouts:
type `'`, let go, then type `a`, and you get `á`.


When a person types a key on their keyboard, a few things happen. The
keyboard sends a *physical scancode*. Software keyboard layout handling
(i.e. using the Dvorak layout on a QWERTY keyboard) translates this
scancode to an alternate scancode ("i" acts like "c" with Dvorak). The
combination of modifiers (ctrl, alt, etc.) and other keys (i.e. letters)
*may or may not* then produce *one or more* characters (i.e. `alt+p` on
macOS produces "π", but the same on Dvorak on a US physical keyboard
is `alt+r`).


Finally, not all modifiers may be consumed, and that is relevant
for keybindings. For example, if you bind `ctrl+=` on a US layout, that
would be `ctrl+shift+0` on a Norwegian layout, you have to know that
`shift+0` produced `=` but *did not consume* `ctrl`, so the final input
is `ctrl+=`. But if the user also bound `ctrl+shift+0`, which do you
use? 🤔


These explanations are **all very hand-wavy and lack detail.**
I plan on writing an entire blog post dedicated to the eldritch horror
that is keyboard layouts, input handling, terminal keyboard "protocols",
and OS-level APIs so I'm going to skip the details in this devlog. Stay
tuned for that!


Ghostty not only has to handle these use cases (because it turns out
non US-standard keyboard users *exist*) but Ghostty must also do this
*cross-platform* because Ghostty works on macOS and Linux already with
aspirations to also work on Windows. 😰 Well, Ghostty *now does*.


The only visual thing that can be shown is dead key state handling,
which is now rendered with the last pending dead key. You'll just have
to trust me that the rest now works.


In addition to the above, Ghostty now supports optional explicit
*physical key mapping*. If you specify a keybinding as `ctrl+physical:0`
(note the `physical:` prefix), then only the *physical* `0` key will
trigger that binding. On some keyboard layouts, this may make the
keybinding impossible. By default, keybindings are based on logical (translated)
keys.

# Kitty Keyboard Protocol and Others (#292, #295)


If you're tired of learning about keyboard input, just skip this section.


Beyond mapping keyboard keys to character input, keyboard events must also
be mapped to *escape sequences* so that running programs in the terminal
know what key you pressed.


The original terminal protocols sent the characters produced by keyboard
keys as-is. You type "a", you get "a", you type "A" (shift+A), you get "A".
This has [a lot of limitations](https://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/).
For example, terminal programs could not react to modifiers such as
`ctrl-i` and `ctrl-shift-i` since they produced the same data.


Many additional keyboard protocols were developed to address these shortcomings.
xterm developed the [modified keys](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/modified-keys.html)
sequences, Paul Evans developed the [fixterms](https://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/)
protocol, and Kovid Goyal (of Kitty) developed the
[Kitty Keyboard Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/).
The gist of these protocols is that they simply define what the terminal
sends to the running program when keys are pressed.


These aren't hypothetical problems. These protocols are implemented by
`tmux`, `neovim`, and other major programs and let you bind many hundreds
more keybindings than you would would otherwise.


*Ghostty now implements all of these*.


As far as I know, Ghostty is one of only a handful of terminals that
implements *all of these*. I believe only iTerm, Foot, and maybe WezTerm
implement xterm modified keys *and* Kitty. I think only those plus Kitty
implement the Kitty protocol at all. Most terminals (Terminal.app,
Windows Terminal, Alacritty, Warp) implement *none* of the keyboard protocols.2


Here is a video showing the Kitty keyboard protocol working:

# The Year of Desktop Linux (GTK)


The last batch of beta users increased our full-time Linux user
count from just a couple to around 5 or 6, and with it came *many* improvements
in the Linux experience.


First, **GTK single instance mode** (#247) is now enabled and supported.
For GTK, Ghostty now runs a single process. Launching Ghostty a second time
opens a new window in the existing Ghostty process. This plays nicely with
standard graphical desktop environments and also makes launching Ghostty
*super fast* after the first launch.


Next, Ghostty now has **primary (selection) clipboard support** (#266).
Linux desktops have multiple clipboards. The "primary" (or "selection")
keyboard is where text is automatically copied for text selections, and
pasting is usually done via the middle mouse button. This is a *separate
clipboard* from where `ctrl+shift+c` and `ctrl+shift+v` go, so you can have
multiple items on your clipboard. This feature is sometimes controversial,
so don't worry, you can disable it with the `copy-on-select` configuration.
You can see this work in the video below. Note that I'm *not* pressing any
keyboard bindings; this is only using the selection clipboard.


Linux now supports **automatic shell integration** (#245). I talked about
[shell integration in Devlog 001](http://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-devlog-001#automatic-shell-integration-injection-191).
Previously, Linux users had to set an environment variable to point to
Ghostty's `share` directory. The Linux application now searches up from
the `ghostty` executable for a `share` directory with the proper folder
structure. If you install Ghostty using a standard
[FHS directory layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard)
(the standard layout Ghostty packages up in), then Ghostty will automatically
find and configure your shell.


And a lot more, the Ghostty app icon shows up properly (#251), the
GTK application handles non-US keyboard layouts (#271), the GTK
application supports semi-transparent window backgrounds (#264), and more.


I really want Ghostty to be a top-tier GTK-based Linux terminal. I don't
use GTK full time so I am really dependent on testers to provide feedback
to make this experience great. I'm really happy to report that Ghostty
is feeling really good on GTK now! The GTK application is still lagging
behind the macOS experience but I'm looking forward to bringing it up to
parity!

# Fin


The most recent round of beta testers have been *so amazing*. I want to
thank [@hovsater](https://github.com/hovsater) for exposing all the glaring
keyboard layout and mapping issues and pushing me to fix them all.
[@cryptocode](https://github.com/cryptocode) exposed a dozen or so bugs
around edge cases with wide characters, multi-codepoint graphemes, and
their interaction with selection and soft-wrapping. And there are a number
of new testers worthy of thanks for the Linux improvements. Thank you!

## Footnotes

1. This is a reference to the excellent blog post
[Text Rendering Hates You](https://faultlore.com/blah/text-hates-you/)
which I highly recommended. ↩
2. I have a lot of respect for all of these terminal emulator
authors and I hope this doesn't seem like any attack. I'm only trying
to factually state what features they do and do not support. If I'm
wrong, please let me know and I'll fix this right away. ↩
