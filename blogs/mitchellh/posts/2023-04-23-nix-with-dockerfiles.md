[Nix](https://nixos.org/) is a powerful cross-platform package management tool.
The benefits of Nix are far reaching, but one big benefit is that once you
adopt Nix, you can get a consistent environment across development (on both Linux
and Mac), CI, and production.


I've been [using Nix for many years](https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1649503702456340483)
and recently started building Docker images using a Dockerfile paired with Nix.
This post will explain the benefits of this approach along with a basic example
to show how it looks and feels.


**Sorry, this is not a Nix introduction post.** You don't need to know how
to use Nix to read this post, but I am also not going to explain basic Nix
concepts or introduce the Nix language. If you do not know Nix, you can still
read this post and use it to determine if Nix is interesting for you to learn.

# Dockerfiles Are Easy, Why Nix?


Dockerfiles are quite easy -- you just chain together shell commands --
so understandably there is some hesitation to introduce a tool like Nix
into the mix. The practical reason is that if you use Nix, you'll get
always-working environments on local machines, CI, Docker, and more *for free*1;
you have little to no duplicated effort.


A typical, non-Nix approach is to have a separate effort for local development,
CI, and Docker (we'll call Docker our "production" environment since this
blog post is about building Docker images):

- For local development, you may have a giant README, may use Docker compose, may use
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), etc.
- Then, when you need to run or test your code in CI, you're probably writing
YAML definitions to setup the environment again. A lot of times, the CI
environment is different enough that you have slightly different shell
requirements.
- Finally, for production, you have a Dockerfile with its own set of shell
commands to run to build your final image.


Individually, this is *fine*, although I'd argue still a bit annoying. But
when you put it all together, it is very annoying and very brittle. I hope
I'm not the only one that has updated the local development environment and
Dockerfile for a feature only to realize I broke CI. Or got my development
environment working and a green check mark ✅ on a PR only to realize
that the production runtime is now broken.


**These problems all go away with Nix.** Nix is your single source of truth
of what you need to *build and run* your software. You update this single
source of truth and it generally just works everywhere. You don't need to
maintain multiple descriptions of how to build and run your software anymore.


I'm serious, I haven't had a "works on my machine [but not on others]"
issue in *years*. Not a single one. I'm actively trying to work through
my [Nix God complex](https://www.reddit.com/r/NixOS/comments/kauf1m/dealing_with_post_nixflake_god_complex/).
It has been so long that when I see non-Nix users complain about issues
getting software to run in various environments, I'm truly confused. It's
like someone looking at a river and lamenting about having to wade through
to cross it while I'm riding a bicycle across a bridge.


This is just one benefit, but I think it is the most practical one. Nix
purists2 will tout other things such as purism, reproducibility, powerful
language, etc. This is all true, but I think the real pain point is
**you want your environments to Just Work.**


In isolation, I submit to you that using Nix with Docker is mostly just
harder than using Docker by itself. But by realizing the compounding benefits
of using Nix to then be able to enhance your CI and development environments
with the same configuration, using Nix with Docker becomes *easier* than
using Docker by itself and also has numerous other practical benefits.


**I'm going to focus on Docker images in this blog post,** so I won't be
showing how to use the same configuration for CI, development, etc. in
any sort of detail. There are numerous blog posts on these topics. For
local development environments, see [Nix and Direnv](https://determinate.systems/posts/nix-direnv).
For CI, take a look [at my own GitHub Actions workflows](https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev/blob/e7d4e6dfd208b4d90715766f92aeaf0163e4bdd9/.github/workflows/test.yml#L48).

# The Big Idea


I want to explain the big idea at a high level, then I'll show a real
example with code and shell commands. The idea is:

1. Write Nix code to describe how to build and run your application.
2. Use a Dockerfile and the [official Nix image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nixos/nix)
to build your application using Nix using roughly one shell command.
3. Use a multi-stage build `FROM scratch` to copy your built application
into the smallest possible image. This final image doesn't have Nix
installed at all -- we just used Nix to build.


Step 1 is the reusable bit. This same code can also be used to build
a development or CI environment. As noted earlier, I won't go into detail
about that in this blog post.


There are other "Nix and Docker" blog posts out there that use *only Nix*
to build Docker images and don't use `docker` or Dockerfiles at all. That
is possible and completely fine, but I wanted to write about using a Dockerfile
because it is likely more familiar and less intimidating to people and
because so many tools in the ecosystem often ingest and use Dockerfiles.

# An Example: Python and Flask


As a real world example, I will use Nix to build a Docker image for
running a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) web application.
The complete code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mitchellh/flask-nix-example).


## The Python App


We aren't here to learn to learn Flask, so you can view the Flask application
code in `src/app.py`. It looks roughly like the below code block. It is
just the Flask quickstart code to output "Hello World" on the root page.


```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello_world():
    return "<p>Hello, World!</p>"

```


## Nix Flake


Next, we need to create a Nix flake to describe how to build your application.
A Nix flake is a kind of Nix environment that describes how to create
development environments, build packages, etc. It is similar to a `pyproject.toml`
or `Cargo.toml` or `go.mod` or `package.json` and so on, but for Nix.


The Nix flake is in `flake.nix` and looks like this:


```nix
{
  description = "flask-example";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/release-22.11";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
      in with pkgs; rec {
        # Development environment
        devShell = mkShell {
          name = "flask-example";
          nativeBuildInputs = [ python3 poetry ];
        };

        # Runtime package
        packages.app = poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
          projectDir = ./.;
        };

        # The default package when a specific package name isn't specified.
        defaultPackage = packages.app;
      }
    );
}

```


**Did you just tell me to go f*ck myself? ([Comic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfzCjAPWkAAS3Qs?format=png))**
Before I learned Nix, this is usually how I felt whenever someone dropped
a block of Nix code. Seeing any unfamiliar code for the first time is usually
intimidating and on top of that Nix isn't the most aesthetically pleasing, but
please hang in there since this is the last time you'll see Nix code in this
blog post and its mostly inconsequential to the remainder of this post.


Most of this is boilerplate. The key bits are the lines with `devShell`
and `packages.app`. `devShell` creates our development environment with
Python and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed. And `packages.app`
describes how to build our final package. Nix has first-class knowledge of
Poetry, so we can just ask it to build our Poetry application. Most mainstream
languages have a similar high-level helper to make using Nix easier.


[Install Nix on your system](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
and you can verify everything works by running `nix build`. This should build
the package and you can run the application at `result/bin/app`.


```
$ nix build
...

$ result/bin/app
 * Serving Flask app 'src.app'
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

```


**Pause! This is low-key amazing.** If you're unfamiliar with Nix, the
impressiveness of what just happened may have gone unnoticed. Take a look
at what `result/bin/app` is (`cat` it) and follow that rabbit hole. It
is a script to run your Python app that depends only on Nix-installed software.
*It does not depend on or conflict with your local system at all*. If you
have other versions of Python, Flask, etc. installed, it won't matter at all;
your app is perfectly packaged.


## Dockerfile


Now let's bring it all together with Docker. Here is the `Dockerfile`:


```dockerfile
# Nix builder
FROM nixos/nix:latest AS builder

# Copy our source and setup our working dir.
COPY . /tmp/build
WORKDIR /tmp/build

# Build our Nix environment
RUN nix \
    --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
    --option filter-syscalls false \
    build

# Copy the Nix store closure into a directory. The Nix store closure is the
# entire set of Nix store values that we need for our build.
RUN mkdir /tmp/nix-store-closure
RUN cp -R $(nix-store -qR result/) /tmp/nix-store-closure

# Final image is based on scratch. We copy a bunch of Nix dependencies
# but they're fully self-contained so we don't need Nix anymore.
FROM scratch

WORKDIR /app

# Copy /nix/store
COPY --from=builder /tmp/nix-store-closure /nix/store
COPY --from=builder /tmp/build/result /app
CMD ["/app/bin/app"]

```


This is a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/).
We first start with our `builder` container which is based on `nixos/nix`.
This is the Nix official base image that just has `nix` installed.


In this builder, we first run `nix build`:


```dockerfile
RUN nix \
    --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
    --option filter-syscalls false \
    build

```


This is just what we did earlier. The extra flags are to ensure the
Nix command has `flakes` available (they're still marked as experimental)
and the `filter-syscalls` option lets Apple Silicon cross-compile to Intel
if you want.


The next step is:


```dockerfile
RUN mkdir /tmp/nix-store-closure
RUN cp -R $(nix-store -qR result/) /tmp/nix-store-closure

```


This is the critical step. `nix store -qR result` outputs the full list
of Nix directories that our application needs. Specifically, it is the
*closure* of dependencies that only our application needs. I know this can
be confusing, so to put it one final way: it is the smallest possible set of
dependencies (files and folders) that our application needs to run and
literally nothing else.


Finally, we use a `from scratch` container to build our final image:


```dockerfile
FROM scratch

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=builder /tmp/nix-store-closure /nix/store
COPY --from=builder /tmp/build/result /app
CMD ["/app/bin/app"]

```


We copy our closure into `/nix/store`, which ensures that we have all
the dependencies our application needs. Then we copy the `result` symlink
to `/app`. Then, we set `/app/bin/app` as the entrypoint. This is similar
to how we ran `resuilt/bin/app` above when testing our Nix file.


## Try it!


Build and run the Docker image:


```
$ docker build -t flask-example:dev .
...

$ docker run --rm flask-example:dev
 * Serving Flask app 'src.app'
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit

```

# Downsides


There aren't many downsides to building Docker images this way, but in
the interest in intellectual honesty, I'll note as many as I can think of.


The most obvious downside is that this requires Nix knowledge. Nix has
a reputation for not being particularly easy to learn. In recent years,
Nix documentation has improved greatly and there are additional resources
like [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/) which help a lot. Additionally
the [Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer) landscape
has gotten much, much better.


Given the non-zero time cost to learning Nix, I think this downside is
only worth it if you plan on using Nix for additional functionality such
as CI or development environments as well. In my opinion, if you end up
learning Nix this is inevitable because it's just *so dang nice*.


Another downside is that the layers produced in the Docker image are
not optimal. The single `RUN nix build` command produces a giant layer with
all the dependencies in it. From a build-time perspective, this is really
fast because almost all of your dependencies will be downloaded from a binary
cache. But, it is not optimal for caching and basically every redeploy
will require your runtime environment to redownload the largest layer
of your image.


Nix is able to make more optimal Docker image layers by using the
native Nix `dockerTools` to build an image instead of a Dockerfile, but
the whole point of this blog post is to show you the Dockerfile approach.

# Next


I think that was pretty easy. The Dockerfile is less than 15 lines (without
comments) and by using Nix its using the exact same code you'd use to
build your development and CI environments, so its all shared logic. The
Dockerfile never has to change.


This uses a plain-old Dockerfile so it integrates really nicely with
tools you're likely familiar with already such as `docker`, various
CI/CD tools, PaaS offerings, etc.


Finally, you get all the extra benefits of Nix: your Docker image
has the smallest possible set of files to run your application and nothing more,
the contents of your Docker image are reproducible (metadata may change the
hash of the image itself), etc. These may or may not be important to you,
but they have no downside and you get them for free.


As I said earlier, the benefits of this approach compound *greatly*
when you start reusing your Nix configuration for other environments
such as local development and CI. Therefore, I recommend using this approach
to enhance your current Nix usage or as a gateway to more expanded Nix usage.

1. With the arguably high up front cost of learning Nix, yes, but I
think the payoff is way higher than the cost of admission. ↩
