As of [this PR](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/pull/959#top),
[simdutf](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf)
can be used without libc++ or libc++abi1.


Simdutf was the final remaining libc++ dependency in
[libghostty-vt](https://libghostty.tip.ghostty.org)2.
After [updating Ghostty to use this new simdutf build](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/12291),
we were able to remove libc++ and libc++abi completely from our dependencies.


**Note** that at the time of writing this, the upstream
simdutf PR is not merged, and I don't know if it will be merged.
Initial feedback is positive, but the maintainers may choose not to merge
it for any reason. The Ghostty project has already incorporated the
no-libc++ simdutf build into our main branch.


## The Benefits of Not Depending on libc++


Not depending on libc++ makes a library more portable (embedded, WebAssembly,
freestanding environments), simplifies cross-compilation (no target-specific
C++ standard library needed), reduces binary size, and can simplify
static linking.


As a general purpose, low-level library, simdutf should be as portable and
flexible as possible. If a downstream consumer can easily use libc++,
great! But if they can't, they shouldn't be blocked from using simdutf
since it fundamentally doesn't need it.


## libc++ vs libc++abi


There are two parts to extricating a program from libc++.


First, `libc++` is the C++ standard library, which provides things like
`std::vector`, `std::string`, etc. If you import `<vector>` or even the libc
C++ fallbacks like `<cstring>`, you're depending on libc++.


The sneakier part is `libc++abi`, which provides the C++ ABI, including
things like exception handling, virtual function tables, RTTI, etc.
If you use any C++ features that require these, you're depending on libc++abi,
even if you don't import any C++ standard library headers *at all*.


For example, the minimal C++ program below depends on libc++abi
because it uses function-local static variables, which require thread-safe
initialization that is part of the C++ ABI:


```
struct Implementation {
    int version;
};

const Implementation& get_impl() {
    static const Implementation impl{1};
    return impl;
}

int main() {
    return get_impl().version;
}
```


## Extricating simdutf from libc++


Let's talk about `libc++` first (not the ABI).


simdutf is a C++ library that makes heavy use of the latest and greatest C++ features and though
I don't know him personally, [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/en/) seems
to really love utilizing C++ features to their fullest extent. So, simdutf is
very much a C++ project.


For there to be any chance that my changes would be accepted, I had to make
sure that the project could continue to use C++ features without it
being a headache.


### STL Usage


The approach I decided to take was to introduce a
[`stl_compat.h` header](https://github.com/mitchellh/simdutf/blob/nolibcxx/include/simdutf/internal/stl_compat.h)
that centralizes all of the C++ standard library types. In
normal libc++ mode, everything in `stl_compat.h` is a simple include or
minimal alias to the corresponding C++ standard library type with no runtime
overhead.


In `NO_LIBCXX` mode, `stl_compat.h` provides its own implementations of the
C++ types that simdutf uses, but only just enough for them to be compatible
with what simdutf needs. For example, `stl_compat.h` provides its own
implementation of `std::pair`.


As a result, the changes required end up mostly looking like this
throughout the diff:


```
-std::pair<const char *, char32_t *>
+internal::pair<const char *, char32_t *>
arm_convert_latin1_to_utf32(const char *buf, size_t len,
                            char32_t *utf32_output) {
```


### ABI Compatibility


My goal was to retain as much ABI compatibility as possible.
Some of the [public ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
expose C++ types such as `std::string`, so in those scenarios, ABI
had to be broken. Otherwise, it is fully retained.


Given `SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX` is a new feature that applies changes
to the compilation unit, I felt that it was acceptable to break ABI
*only when this flag is present*. In the existing case where the
`NO_LIBCXX` flag is not present, the ABI is fully retained and simdutf can be
updated without breaking ABI for existing users.


I was pleasantly surprised to find that the ABI breakage was very minimal,
and only applied to a handful of diagnostic functions (e.g. to get
the name of the active implementation) and helpers to work with other
C++ types (e.g. text encoding `std::string`). Since by definition someone
using `SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX` is not interested in libc++, these ABI
breakages felt like a feature rather than a bug.


## Extricating simdutf from libc++abi


This task was significantly more complex.


The main problem was that `libc++abi` dependencies don't usually show up as
obvious source-level includes. They show up because the compiler quietly emits
calls into the C++ ABI runtime for ordinary-looking language features.
To detect these, I had to write a script that decompiles the object files
and looks for symbols such as `__cxa_guard_acquire`.


The biggest offender in simdutf was the runtime dispatch layer. The original
code relied heavily on function-local static variables. In C++, those locals
are guarded by thread-safe initialization helpers such as `__cxa_guard_acquire`
and `__cxa_guard_release`, which are provided by the C++ ABI runtime. So even
though the code didn't mention libc++abi anywhere, the compiled object still depended on it.
The fix for this is to use translation-unit static variables instead of
function-local statics in `NO_LIBCXX` mode.


```
#if SIMDUTF_IMPLEMENTATION_ICELAKE
  #ifdef SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX
static const icelake::implementation icelake_singleton{};
  #endif
static const icelake::implementation *get_icelake_singleton() {
  #ifdef SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX
  return &icelake_singleton;
  #else
  static const icelake::implementation icelake_singleton{};
  return &icelake_singleton;
  #endif
}
#endif
```


Next, simdutf models each backend as a subclass of an abstract `implementation`
interface. That design can stay, but abstract-class vtables still reference
`__cxa_pure_virtual` for impossible-to-call pure virtual entries.
In `SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX` mode I chose to provide a tiny local shim
and ensure the runtime never actually reaches it. I marked this as weak
so that the symbol can be overridden by the C++ ABI if it is present.


```
#ifdef SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX
// The abstract implementation vtable still carries pure-virtual slots even
// though correct dispatch never reaches them in this build mode. Provide the
// narrowest possible ABI shim so stricter no-libcxx objects do not require
// libc++abi just for this unreachable hook. Keep it weak so a toolchain's real
// libc++abi definition wins if one is linked in anyway.
extern "C" SIMDUTF_WEAK [[noreturn]] void __cxa_pure_virtual() noexcept {
  __builtin_trap();
}
#endif
```


Finally, I wrote a script to audit the build with `-fno-exceptions` and
`-fno-rtti` and check that no symbols such as `__cxa_guard_*`,
`__gxx_personality`, `__cxa_throw`, `typeinfo`, or `__dynamic_cast` ever show
up. This was added to the simdutf CI to ensure that we never accidentally
reintroduce libc++abi dependencies in the future for `NO_LIBCXX` builds.


## Validation


### Internal


simdutf is a correctness and performance critical library, so I had to be
sure my changes didn't impact either of those. I modified the pre-existing
test and benchmark suites to run in both `NO_LIBCXX` and normal modes
and ensured that all tests passed and benchmarks were unaffected.


The important part about this is that I committed the changes necessary
to ensure that the `NO_LIBCXX` mode is compatible with the existing
test and benchmark suites. This means that future changes to simdutf
can continue to validate both.


### External: Ghostty


Next, I updated Ghostty to use the new simdutf from my fork, updated
our builds to use `SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX`, and added our own suite of tests
to verify our artifacts have no dependencies on libc++ or libc++abi.


Ghostty has a robust set of tests that verify our UTF-8 decoding behavior
(especially invalid inputs). And Ghostty has a built-in benchmark suite
that tests our UTF-8 throughput in a variety of scenarios. I ran all the
Ghostty tests and benchmarks and verified that they all passed and that our
UTF-8 performance was unaffected, as expected.


## Pull Request


Getting something working and getting something merged are two different things.


I know too well as a maintainer myself the disparity between "this works"
and "this can be merged." I know the challenges of verifying someone's work
and being confident in maintaining it going forward. I know the challenge of
opening a large PR and not having clarity of why it is being opened.
And I know the burden of recent AI slop.


So I put in the effort I would
want from an all-star contributor and tried to be that person for the
simdutf maintainers.


First, I reviewed the entire diff (yes, all ~3,000 lines of it). Then I
reviewed it again. I re-read the entire diff by hand three or four times.
I made multiple changes based on things I probably would've commented
on myself, even if functionally it was fine.


Next, I hand-wrote a detailed PR description that explains the motivation,
the approach, the limitations, and the validation. I wanted to make sure that
the maintainers were aware of the details but also how much thought I put
into the details.


Finally, I disclosed that I did use AI to assist me in writing the code. But
I made it clear that I manually reviewed everything, I didn't use AI in writing
any of the PR description or comments, and that I was capable and comfortable
as a human to defend and modify any proposed changes.


Ironically, the full diff took me about 2 hours to put together, but the
extra validation work and PR preparation took me about 3 hours. I spent more
time on the human boundary than the code itself, as we should out of respect
for the effort maintainers put into their projects.


## Final Status


The [simdutf PR](https://github.com/simdutf/simdutf/pull/959) is still
under review. Initial feedback is positive, and I'm open to any and all
changes requested of me. There's a possibility that the maintainers will not
want to merge it, and that's okay, too.


If you want to use simdutf without libc++ or libc++abi, you can
[use my fork](https://github.com/mitchellh/simdutf/tree/nolibcxx) in the
meantime. The same instructions for producing an amalgamated single-file plus
header build apply. When building the C++ and including the header, just
make sure to define `SIMDUTF_NO_LIBCXX` to get the no-libc++ version of
the library.


The [Ghostty PR](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/12291) is
now merged. As such, `libghostty-vt` no longer depends on libc++ or libc++abi
for SIMD builds.

etc.) and libc++abi is the C++ ABI library (e.g. exception handling, RTTI,
etc.). ↩
2. Note that with SIMD disabled, libghostty-vt has always had
zero dependencies, not even libc. It is a fully freestanding library. ↩
