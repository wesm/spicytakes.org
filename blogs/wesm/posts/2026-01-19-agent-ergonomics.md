I have been building a lot of new software in Go. Except that I've
never actually written a line of Go in my life. ***What is going on?***

Anyone following my [LinkedIn][1] or [Twitter/X][2] feed has seen that
I have been down a coding agent rabbit hole in recent months. This has
included:

* [moneyflow][3], a TUI accounting system (written in Python)
* [roborev][4], a continuous background code review system (written in
  Go). *roborev has totally transformed my productivity, by the way.*
* [VibePulse][5], a mediocre version of [CodexBar][7] (written in Swift)
* [agent-session-viewer][6], a session history viewer and search tool
  for your coding agent sessions (written in Python)

I have multiple other in-progress projects I've been creating on
nights and weekends that I either plan to open source in the future or
retain just for me. I'm working harder and having more fun building
than I have in years.

## Python and Agents

Python remains a remarkably effective language. It's concise,
readable, and has one of the strongest ecosystems of libraries of all
time.

But agentic engineering is different:

* Fast compile-test cycles matter more than code simplicity and
  readability. Agents compile-and-test one-to-two orders of magnitude
  more often than their human counterparts, so any extra friction here
  is punishing.
* Painless software distribution feels essential. You may create
  numerous tools to enable your "agentic loop" and self-contained,
  dependency-free binaries accessible in a coding agent context feels
  like the right modality.
* Human ergonomics matter less when humans aren't the primary authors.

In this context, Python has weaknesses: its test cycles are relatively
slow and distribution has challenges (though `uv` helps). Dragging
around a Python interpreter has started to feel like the Java Virtual
Machine from which we tried so desperately to unburden ourselves.

The *reasons* that Python has gotten so popular (and why I went down
the Python rabbit hole back in 2007 and dedicated many years of my
life to popularizing Python for data analysis) is that it is
productive and pleasant for humans to write and use. As the hours and
days pass by, this benefit feels increasingly moot compared with the
evident downsides (performance, memory use, distribution, etc.),
especially with an agent doing all the coding for you.

***Put another way, human ergonomics in programming languages matter
much less now.*** The readability and simplicity benefits of Python
help LLMs generate code, too, but viewed through the "annealing" lens
of the iterative agentic loop, quicker iterations translate to net
improved productivity even factoring in the "overhead" of generating
code in a more verbose or more syntactically complex language.

## Frictionless Development and Shipping

The winners of this shift to agentic engineering are the languages
that have solved the build system, runtime performance, packaging, and
distribution problems. Increasingly that looks like Go and Rust:

* Painlessly build static binaries with zero runtime dependencies
* Predictable dependency management and code sharing
* Fast, deterministic builds
* Lean resource footprint, no just-in-time compilation, good runtime
  performance

From my experience, Go even has a substantial edge over Rust due to
its ultrafast compile times for release builds (while Rust release
builds can take minutes of linking and optimization). Rust has memory
safety without garbage collection and deterministic resource
management, while Go trades some of that control for faster
compilation and a simpler concurrency model. Some projects may choose
one or the other purely based on these characteristics (with Rust's
slower compile-test loops as an acceptable tradeoff).

For now, LLMs have strong Python programming skills because of the
massive amounts of training data mined from GitHub and the broader
internet, and so it may be that average code quality is better in
Python now than it is in Go or Rust, but perhaps after multiple
agentic iterations and automated code reviews, it may be good enough.

To be clear, I am not trying to say that Go and Rust are not very
ergonomic for humans. These are already popular languages that we all
use for critical applications, such as Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform,
Deno, or uv. What's interesting is that agents have made these
languages much more accessible beyond their prior core user base of
heavy duty systems engineering. Go is a great language to program in
for systems work, microservices, and distributed computing, but in
general there is more of a learning curve to working in it and in the
past building a Go project as a rule of thumb would take longer than
building the same project in Python.

## What about Data Science and AI?

Python isn't going anywhere as long as its moat as a language for data
work and ML/AI inference and training persists. The ecosystem of
NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, and all the other popular projects represents
decades of accumulated expertise, institutional knowledge, and muscle
memory. While some projects may be reimagined in systems languages
intended primarily for agents, the ecosystem inertia (and abundant
training data) will continue for a long time.

What has changed is where the durable value actually lives. It is
increasingly useful to separate the stack into a few layers:

* The computing, IO, and compiler kernel libraries based on CUDA,
  compiler frameworks like MLIR or JAX's XLA, and of course Apache
  Arrow.
* The database systems and caching layers, ideally connected with
  [ADBC][8]'s zero-serialization connnectivity.
* The language bindings and orchestration layers that expose those
  capabilities.
* The application or agent interfaces that sit on top.

When viewed this way, most of the long term value clearly resides in
the first two layers (compute and data access), not the last two.

## Code review: more machine than man

An obvious downside in shifting away from Python is that I have much
less experience reading and judging the quality of Go code or Rust
code. This is part of why I built [roborev][4], not just because
agents' commits are full of bugs and imperfections, but also because
I'm definitely less effective manually reviewing languages I never
used pre-AI.

## Not the End for Python, but the End of an Era

Python will remain essential as an exploratory computing layer for
humans and agents to collaborate on data analysis, research, and data
visualization. Notebook layers (Jupyter, Marimo, and so forth) and
hybrid IDEs (like Positron, where I've been contributing in the last
couple of years) will increasingly focus on catering to the
human-in-the-loop data scientist or ML engineer, even though the
"Python part" may become thinner and thinner as the lower layers of
the stack are re-engineered for performance and agentic engineering
productivity.

Regardless, I'm proud of what we have accomplished in building the
Python ecosystem and how it has democratized data science and ML/AI
work. I still love the language, but it seems clear that I and much of
the industry will be writing less and less of it given the
agentic-loop productivity benefits of Go and other modern compiled
languages. Where the road leads from here we will soon see.
