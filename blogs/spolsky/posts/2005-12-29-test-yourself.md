By the time I got to Penn for my first year of college, I thought I was already a pretty good programmer. Completely self-taught, I had written two major systems in Turbo Pascal … one of them was a complete inventory system for a small factory, while the other scheduled all the production at one of Israel’s largest bakeries.


It took me until the midterm exams to realize I wasn’t as smart as I thought. I completely screwed up some questions, because I still didn’t get pointers and I still didn’t get recursion.


Never one to hold a grudge, I share those midterm questions with you… see if you can do better than I did freshman year.


1a. (MIT-Scheme) Using the function


```
(define (accumulate combiner null-value l) 
   (if (null? l)
       null-value
       (combiner (car l)
                 (accumulate combiner
                             null-value
                             (cdr l)))))


```


Implement **sum-of-squares**, which calculates the sum of squares of a list, for example


```
(sum-of-squares '(1 2 3 4 5))

```


should evaluate to 55.


(For the answer, select the text in the box:)


```
(define (sum-of-squares l)
   (accumulate (lambda (x y) (+ (* x x) y))
               0
               l))

```


1b. (JavaScript) OK, maybe Scheme is not your thing. This question is equivalent to 1a, in JavaScript.


Using the function


```
function accumulate(combiner, nullValue, l)
{
	if (l.length == 0)
		return nullValue;
	var first = l.shift();
	return combiner(first, accumulate(combiner, nullValue, l));
}

```


Implement **sumOfSquares**, which calculates the sum of squares of a list, for example


```
sumOfSquares([1,2,3,4,5])

```


should evaluate to 55.


(For the answer, select the text in the box:)


```
function sumOfSquares(lst)
{
	return accumulate(function(x,y){return x*x+y}, 0, lst);
}

```


2. (ANSI C) Write a C program of the following form:


```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
   ???
}

```


such that, after compiling it, it can be executed as


```
% ./a.out could harold eat eight salami elephants

```


and it will print the first letter of every argument (in this case, “cheese”).


(For the answer, select the text in the box:)


```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  int i;
  for (i=1; i<argc; i++)
  {
    putchar(argv[i][0]);
  }
  putchar('\n');
  return 0;
}

```


3. (ANSI C) What is the output of the following C program?


```
#include <stdio.h>

char *fn(int i, char *s)
{
  while (i)
  {
    s++;
    i--;
  }

  return s;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  int a = 2;
  static char c[] = "test";

  printf("%s\n", fn(a,c));

  return 0;
}


```


(For the answer, select the text in the box:)


```
st (followed by a newline)

```
