During a vacation in the rain forests of Queensland in 2001, we saw some [strangler figs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangler_fig). These
  are vines that germinate in a nook of a tree. As it grows, it draws nutrients
  from the host tree until it reaches the ground to grow roots and the canopy to
  get sunlight. It can then become self-sustaining, and its original host tree
  may die leaving the fig as an echo of its shape. This gradual process of
  replacing the host tree struck me as a striking
  analogy to the way I saw colleagues doing modernization of legacy software
  systems. A couple of years later I posted a brief blog post about this
  metaphor. While I've not used the term in my writing since then, it caught
  attention anyway, and the term âStrangler Figâ is now often used to describe a
  gradual approach to legacy modernization. 1


1: 
       The original post was just entitled âStrangler Applicationâ. This led to
       people often using âstranglerâ and forgetting the botanical origin of the
       name. As the term gained popularity I became concerned about this due to
       its connotations of violence. The difficulty was that once a term sticks,
       it's very hard to change. I decided to try a subtle change, replacing the
       title with âStrangler Fig Applicationâ to emphasize its metaphorical routes.
       Fortunately the new title strangled the old one.

These days, software systems underpin much of human activity, but often don't do
  a great job of it. They were built over the course of decades, often with
  little investment and care to keeping them healthy. As business needs and
  technology platforms change, this software needs to change too, but these
  changes are often done by building patch upon patch, each patch making it
  harder to adapt to future changes. Eventually people realize that they can't
  patch any more, and need a wholesale modernization.


Faced with this choice, it is easy to think of the exercise as a simple
  replacement. We know what the old system does, so just build a new system that
  does exactly the same, but in a new and better technology that is easier to
  support changes. But we've seen this simple-sounding plan go down in
  flames most of the time. Replacing a serious IT system takes a long time, and the users
  can't wait for new features. Replacements seem easy to specify, but often it's
  hard to figure out the details of existing behavior. What's worse, much of
  that behavior is stuff that isn't really wanted, so building it is a waste.


The alternative that my colleagues and I prefer, is to do a gradual
  process of modernization. Like the fig, it begins with small additions,
  often new features, that are built on top of, yet separate to the legacy code
  base. As we do this we move bits of behavior from the legacy system into the
  new code base.


Ian Cartwright, Rob Horn, and James Lewis [defined four high-level
  activities](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/) that we need for this kind of incremental approach.

1. Understand the outcomes you want to achieve
2. Decide how to break the problem up into smaller parts
3. Successfully deliver the parts
4. Change the organization to allow this to happen on an ongoing basis


(The ordering here does *not* imply a sequence.)


To embark on a modernization activity, we need to be crystal clear about
   our desired outcomes. Too often we see muddled objectives, with different
  groups wanting different things. We need to establish alignment on the key
  outcomes early, and then revisit regularly to reinforce the alignment and to
  investigate if there should be a shift in priority.


Ideally, software should consist of clear components that can be replaced
  independently. Legacy systems rarely exhibit this characteristic, so there's
  considerable work in figuring out how to break it down into manageable pieces,
  This will involve identifying [seams](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/LegacySeam.html)
  that we can insert into the system to allow it to be split2. It's often useful to identify how a system supports multiple
  business needs and to extract individual needs into new components.


2: 
    In a well-designed system, these seams would already exist. But such
    systems are unicorns.


Once we have seams to isolate a few components, we can start replacing
  them. Since these components are small, there isn't so much risk involved when
  we introduce the new software. Once working, the business can reap the
  value from these new components, allowing earlier
  return on the investment. We also learn more about how to replace the legacy
  system, and its consequences for the business, which helps us make better
  decisions as the modernization continues.


When doing this, people often balk at the necessity of building [transitional architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/transitional-architecture.html) to allow the new and legacy
  system to coexist, code that will go away once the modernization is complete.
  While this may appear to be a waste, the reduced risk and earlier value from
  the gradual approach outweigh its costs.


Threaded through all of this is broader organizational change. Legacy
  systems become rigid and brittle because the design thinking and
  organizational processes that produced them built them that way. If there's no
  change in organizational culture and leadership, the new systems will end up
  in a similar mess. So we also need to introduce new development practices,
  including reorganizing the development organization and its connections with
  the wider business in recognition of [Conways Law](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html).


Using a Strangler Fig approach to Legacy Modernization doesn't make the
  exercise easy. Replacing a software system that's deeply embedded with
  business processes is never going to be an easy task. What this approach does
  do is make both investment and returns occur gradually and visibly, allowing
  the organization to evolve its software and business process to better support
  the current environment, and (perhaps more importantly) evolve its way of
  doing that to something more sustainable for the future.
