A common debate in software development projects is between spending time
    on improving the quality of the software versus concentrating on releasing
    more valuable features. Usually the pressure to deliver functionality
    dominates the discussion, leading many developers to complain that they
    don't have time to work on architecture and code quality.


[Betteridge's Law of headlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines) is an
    adage that says any article with a headline or title that ends in a question
    mark can be summarized by ânoâ. Those that know me would not doubt my desire
    to subvert such a law. But this article goes further than that - it subverts
    the question itself. The question assumes the common trade-off between
    quality and cost. With this article I'll explain that this trade-off does
    not apply to software - that high quality software is actually cheaper to
    produce.


Although most of my writing is aimed at professional software developers,
    for this article I'm not going to assume any knowledge of the mechanics of
    software development. My hope is that this is an article that can be
    valuable to anyone involved with thinking about software efforts,
    particularly those, such as business leaders, that act as customers of
    software development teams.


## We are used to a trade-off between quality and cost


As I mentioned in the opening, we are all used to a trade-off between
      quality and cost. When I replace my smart phone, I can choose a
      more expensive model with faster processor, better screen, and more
      memory. Or I can give up some of those qualities to pay less money. It's
      not an absolute rule, sometimes we can get bargains where a high quality
      good is cheaper. More often we have different values to quality - some people
      don't really notice how one screen is nicer than another. But the
      assumption is true most of the time, higher quality usually costs more.


## Software quality means many things


If I'm going to talk about quality for software, I need to explain what
      that is. Here lies the first complication - there are many things that can
      count as quality for software. I can consider the user-interface: does it easily
      lead me through the tasks I need to do, making me more efficient and
      removing frustrations? I can consider its reliability: does it contain
      defects that cause errors and frustration? Another aspect is its
      architecture: is the source code divided into clear modules, so that
      programmers can easily find and understand which bit of the code they need
      to work on this week?


These three examples of quality are not an exhaustive list, but they
      are enough to illustrate an important point. If I'm a customer, or user, of
      the software, I don't appreciate some of the things we'd refer to as
      quality. A user can tell if the user-interface is good. An
      executive can tell if the software is making her staff more efficient at
      their work. Users and customers will notice defects, particularly should
      they corrupt data or render the system inoperative for a while. But
      customers and users cannot perceive the architecture of the software.


I thus divide software quality attributes into **external**
      (such as the UI and defects) and **internal** (architecture). The
      distinction is that users and customers can see what makes a software
      product have high external quality, but cannot tell the difference between
      higher or lower internal quality.


## At first glance, internal quality does not matter to customers


Since internal quality isn't something that customers or users can see
      - does it matter? Let's imagine Rebecca and I write an application to
      track and predict flight delays. Both our applications do the same
      essential function, both have equally elegant user interfaces, and both
      have hardly any defects. The only difference is that her internal source
      code is neatly organized, while mine is a tangled mess. There is one other
      difference: I sell mine for $6 and she sells hers for $10.


Since a customer never sees this source code, and it doesn't affect the
      operation of the app, why would anyone pay an extra $4 for Rebecca's software?
      Put more generally this should mean that it isn't worth paying more money
      for higher internal quality.


Another way I put this is that it makes sense to trade cost for
      external quality but it makes no sense to trade cost for internal quality.
      A user can judge whether they want to pay more to get a better user
      interface, since they can assess whether the user interface is sufficiently
      nicer to be worth the extra money. But a user can't see the internal
      modular structure of the software, let alone judge that it's better. Why pay
      more for something that has no effect?
      Since that's the case - why should
      any software developer put their time and effort into improving the
      internal quality of their work?


## Internal quality makes it easier to enhance software


So why is it that software developers make an issue out of internal
      quality? Programmers spend most of their time modifying code. Even in a
      new system, almost all programming is done in the context of an existing
      code base. When I want to add a new feature to the software, my first task
      is to figure out how this feature fits into the flow of the existing
      application. I then need to change that flow to let my feature fit in. I
      often need to use data that's already in the application, so I need to
      understand what the data represents, how it relates to the data around it,
      and what data I may need to add for my new feature.


All of this is about me understanding the existing code. But it's very
      easy for software to be hard to understand. Logic can get tangled, the
      data can be hard to follow, the names used to refer to things may have
      made sense to Tony six months ago, but are as mysterious to me as his
      reasons for leaving the company. All of these are forms of what
      developers refer to as **cruft** - the difference between the current code
      and how it would ideally be.


One of the primary features of internal quality is making it easier for
      me to figure out how the application works so I can see how to add things.
      If the software is nicely divided into separate modules, I don't have to
      read all 500,000 lines of code, I can quickly find a few hundred lines in
      a couple of modules. If we've put the effort into clear naming, I can
      quickly understand what the various part of the code does without having
      to puzzle through the details. If the data sensibly follows the language
      and structure of the underlying business, I can easily understand how it
      correlates to the request I'm getting from the customer service reps. 
      Cruft adds to the time it take for me to understand how to make a change,
      and also increases the chance that I'll make a mistake. If I spot my mistakes, then
      there's more time lost as I have to understand what the fault is and how to
      fix it. If I don't spot them, then we get production defects, and more time
      spend fixing things later.


My changes also affect the future. I may see a quick way to put in this
      feature, but it's a route that goes against the modular structure of the
      program, adding cruft. If I take that path, I'll make it quicker for me today, but slow
      down everyone else who has to deal with this code in future weeks and
      months. Once other members of the team make the same decision, an easy to
      modify application can quickly accumulate cruft to the point where every little
      change takes many weeks of effort.


## Customers do care that new features come quickly


Here we see a clue of why internal quality does matter to users and
      customers. Better internal quality makes adding new features easier,
      therefore quicker and cheaper. Rebecca and I may have the same application
      now, but in the next few months Rebecca's high internal quality allows her
      to add new features every week, while I'm stuck trying chop through the
      cruft to get just a single new feature out. I can't compete with Rebecca's
      speed, and soon her software is far more featureful than mine. Then all my customers
      delete my app, and get Rebecca's instead, even as she's able to increase
      her price.

## Visualizing the impact of internal quality


The fundamental role of internal quality is
      that it lowers the cost of future change. But there is some extra effort
      required to write good software, which does impose some cost in the short term.


A way of visualizing this is with the following pseudo-graph, where I
      plot the cumulative functionality of software versus the time (and thus
      cost) to produce it. For most software efforts, the curve looks something
      like this.


![](is-quality-worth-cost/poor.png)


This is what happens with poor internal quality. Progress is rapid
      initially, but as time goes on it gets harder to add new features. Even
      small changes require programmers to understand large areas of code, code
      that's difficult to understand. When they make changes, unexpected
      breakages occur, leading to long test times and defects that need to be
      fixed.


Concentrating on high internal quality is about reducing that drop off
      in productivity. Indeed some products see an opposite effect, where
      developers can accelerate as new features can be easily built by making
      use of prior work. This happy situation is a rarer case, as it requires a
      skilled and disciplined team to make it happen. But we do occasionally see
      it.


![](is-quality-worth-cost/both.png)


The subtlety here is that there is a period where the low internal
      quality is more productive than the high track. During this time there is
      some kind of trade-off between quality and cost. The question, of course,
      is: how long is that period before the lines cross?


At this point we run into why this is a pseudo-graph. There is no way
      of measuring the functionality delivered by a software team. This
      inability to measure output, and thus productivity, makes it impossible to
      put solid numbers on the consequences of low internal quality (which is
      also difficult to measure). An inability to measure output is pretty
      common among professional work - how do we measure the productivity of
      lawyers or doctors?


The way I assess where lines cross is by canvassing the opinion of
      skilled developers that I know. And the answer surprises a lot of folks.
      Developers find poor quality code significantly slows them down within a
      few weeks. So there's not much runway where the trade-off between internal
      quality and cost applies. Even small software efforts benefit from
      attention to good software practices, certainly something I can attest
      from my experience.


## Even the best teams create cruft


Many non-developers tend to think of cruft as something that only
      occurs when development teams are careless and make errors, but even the
      finest teams will inevitably create some cruft as they work.


I like to illustrate this point with a tale of when I was chatting with
      one of our best technical team leads. He'd just finished a project that
      was widely considered to be a great success. The client was happy with the
      delivered system, both in terms of its capabilities and its construction
      time and cost. Our people were positive about the experience of working on
      the project. The tech lead was broadly happy but confessed that the
      architecture of the system wasn't that good. I reacted with âhow could
      that be - you're one of our best architects?â His reply is one familiar to
      any experienced software architect: âwe made good decisions, but only now
      do we understand how we should have built itâ.


Many people, including more than a few in the software industry, liken
      building software to constructing cathedrals or skyscrapers - after all
      why do we use âarchitectâ for senior programmers? But building software
      exists in a world of uncertainty unknown to the physical world. Software's
      customers have only a rough idea of what features they need in a product
      and learn more as the software is built - particularly once early versions
      are released to their users. The building blocks of software development -
      languages, libraries, and platforms - change significantly every few
      years. The equivalent in the physical world would be that customers
      usually add new floors and change the floor-plan once half the building is
      built and occupied, while the fundamental properties of concrete change
      every other year.


Given this level of change, software projects are always creating
      something novel. We hardly ever find ourselves working on a
      well-understood problem that's been solved before. Naturally we learn most
      about the problem as we're building the solution, so it's common for me to
      hear that teams only really best understand what the architecture of their
      software should be after they've spent a year or so building it. Even the
      best teams will have cruft in their software.


The difference is that the best teams both create much less cruft but
      also remove enough of the cruft they do create that they can continue to
      add features quickly. They spend time creating automated tests so that
      they can surface problems quickly and spend less time removing bugs. They
      refactor frequently so that they can remove cruft before it builds up
      enough to get in the way. Continuous integration minimizes cruft
      building up due to team members working at cross-purposes. A common
      metaphor is that it's like cleaning up work surfaces and equipment in the
      kitchen. You can't not make things dirty when you cook, but if you don't
      clean things quickly, muck dries up, is harder to remove, and all the
      dirty stuff gets in the way of cooking the next dish.


## High quality software is cheaper to produce


Summing all of this up:

- Neglecting internal quality leads to rapid build up of cruft
- This cruft slows down feature development
- Even a great team produces cruft, but by keeping internal quality
        high, is able to keep it under control
- High internal quality keeps cruft to a minimum, allowing a team to
        add features with less effort, time, and cost.


Sadly, software developers usually don't do a good job of explaining
      this situation. Countless times I've talked to development teams who say
      âthey (management) won't let us write good quality code because it takes
      too longâ. Developers often justify attention to quality by justifying
      through the need for proper professionalism. But this moralistic
      argument implies that this quality comes at a cost - dooming their
      argument. The annoying thing is that the resulting crufty code both makes
      developers' lives harder, and costs the customer money. When thinking about
      internal quality, I stress that we should only approach it as an economic argument.
      High internal quality reduces the cost of future features, meaning that
      putting the time into writing good code actually reduces cost.


This is why the question that heads this article misses the point. The
      âcostâ of high internal quality software is negative. The usual trade-off
      between cost and quality, one that we are used to for most decisions in
      our life, does not make sense with the internal quality of software. (It
      does for external quality, such as a carefully crafted user-experience.)
      Because the relationship between cost and internal quality is an unusual
      and counter-intuitive relationship, it's usually hard to absorb. But
      understanding it is critical to developing software at maximum
      efficiency.
